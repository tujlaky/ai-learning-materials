# AI Agents

AI Agents represent the next frontier in artificial intelligence - autonomous systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions to achieve specific goals. This section explores the fascinating world of intelligent agents and their real-world applications.

## üéØ What are AI Agents?

AI Agents are autonomous software entities that:
- **Perceive** their environment through sensors or data inputs
- **Process** information using AI algorithms and reasoning
- **Act** in their environment to achieve specified goals
- **Learn** and adapt from their experiences
- **Interact** with other agents, humans, or systems

Unlike traditional software that follows predetermined rules, AI agents can make independent decisions and adapt to changing circumstances.

## üåü Types of AI Agents

### Simple Reflex Agents
- React to current perceptions only
- Follow condition-action rules
- No memory of past states
- Example: Thermostat, simple chatbots

### Model-Based Agents
- Maintain internal state/model of the world
- Track how the world evolves
- Make decisions based on current and past information
- Example: Navigation systems, game AI

### Goal-Based Agents
- Have explicit goals they try to achieve
- Plan actions to reach desired outcomes
- Can handle multiple, potentially conflicting goals
- Example: Personal assistants, autonomous vehicles

### Utility-Based Agents
- Optimize for maximum utility/value
- Handle trade-offs between competing goals
- Make decisions based on expected outcomes
- Example: Trading bots, resource allocation systems

### Learning Agents
- Improve performance through experience
- Adapt to new environments and situations
- Update their knowledge and strategies
- Example: Recommendation systems, adaptive game AI
